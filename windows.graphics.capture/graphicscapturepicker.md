## -remarks

To use an instance of this class in a desktop app (.NET or native C++), you must cast the instance to the [IInitializeWithWindow](/windows/win32/api/shobjidl_core/nn-shobjidl_core-iinitializewithwindow) interface, and pass the owner window for the operation to the [Initialize](/windows/win32/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-iinitializewithwindow-initialize) method. For more information, see [Classes that use IInitializeWithWindow](/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/desktop-to-uwp-supported-api#classes-that-use-iinitializewithwindow).
