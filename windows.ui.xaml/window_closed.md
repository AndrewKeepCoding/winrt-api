## -description
Occurs when the window has closed.

Equivalent **WinUI 2 API for UWP**: [Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Window.Closed](/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.window.closed) (for WinUI in the [Windows App SDK](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/), see the **[Windows App SDK namespaces](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/)**).

## -remarks
The Closed event occurs when a [Window](window.md) closes. However, UWP app typically use a single [Window](window.md) instance, and do not open and close additional [Window](window.md) instances.
