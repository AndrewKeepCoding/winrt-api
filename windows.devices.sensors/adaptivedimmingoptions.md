# Windows.Devices.Sensors.AdaptiveDimmingOptions

<!--
public sealed class AdaptiveDimmingOptions
-->

## -description

Provides the ability to manage the dimming behavior of the PC screen based on whether a user is present, absent, interacting with their device, using an external monitor, or the device is in battery-saver mode.

## -remarks

**Introduced in the May Moment update for Windows 11, Version 22H2, Build 22624.**

We recommend using the AdaptiveDimming APIs instead of the AttentionAwareDimming APIs ([IsAttentionAwareDimmingSupported](humanpresencefeatures_isattentionawaredimmingsupported.md), [IsAttentionAwareDimmingEnabled](humanpresencesettings_isattentionawaredimmingenabled.md)), which are now deprecated.

The user can specify their preferred dimming behavior in the System settings (see [Launch the Windows Settings app](/windows/uwp/launch-resume/launch-settings-app#system)).
