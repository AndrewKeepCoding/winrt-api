# Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.ColorPicker

## -description

Represents a control that lets a user pick a color using a color spectrum, sliders, and text input.

Equivalent **WinUI 2 API for UWP**: [Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.ColorPicker](/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.colorpicker) (for WinUI in the [Windows App SDK](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/), see the **[Windows App SDK namespaces](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/)**).

## -xaml-syntax

```xaml
<ColorPicker .../>
```

## -remarks
A color picker is used to browse through and select colors. By default, it lets a user navigate through colors on a color spectrum, or specify a color in either Red-Green-Blue (RGB), Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV), or Hexadecimal textboxes.

For more info about the ColorPicker control, see [Color picker](/windows/uwp/controls-and-patterns/color-picker).

### Control style and template

You can modify the default [Style](../windows.ui.xaml/style.md) and [ControlTemplate](controltemplate.md) to give the control a unique appearance. For information about modifying a control's style and template, see [XAML styles](/windows/apps/design/style/xaml-styles). XAML also includes resources that you can use to modify the colors of a control in different visual states without modifying the control template. Modifying these resources is preferred to setting properties such as [Background](control_background.md) and [Foreground](control_foreground.md). For more info, see the [Light-weight styling](/windows/apps/design/style/xaml-styles#lightweight-styling) section of the [XAML styles](/windows/apps/design/style/xaml-styles) article.

**WinUI Styles (recommended):** Use [Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.ColorPicker](/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.colorpicker).

**Non-WinUI styles:** When you use the built-in styles, the default style, template, and resources that define the look of the control are included in the generic.xaml file. For design purposes, generic.xaml is available in the \(Program Files)\Windows Kits\10\DesignTime\CommonConfiguration\Neutral\UAP\ &lt;SDK version&gt;\Generic folder from a Windows SDK installation. Light-weight styling resources are available starting in WindowsÂ 10, version 1607 (SDK 14393). Styles and resources from different versions of the SDK might have different values.
