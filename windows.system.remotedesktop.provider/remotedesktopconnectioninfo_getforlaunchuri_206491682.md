-->


## -description

Retrieves a [RemoteDesktopConnectionInfo](xref:Windows.System.RemoteDesktop.Provider.RemoteDesktopConnectionInfo) associated with a remote desktop connection and registers a window with the OS to represent the remote desktop.

## -parameters

### -param launchUri

The launch URI used by the shell to launch the remote desktop client app, with information about the remote desktop session.

### -param windowId

The [WindowId](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.windowid) of the window that will represent the remote desktop.

## -returns

A **RemoteDesktopConnectionInfo** associated with the remote desktop connection.

## -remarks

This call is made by the remote desktop client app running on the local desktop. 

The provider app completes the launch handshake by passing the launch protocol string to **GetForLaunchUri**.


### Launch URIs

The *launchUri* is the URI used in the local PCâ€™s shell to launch the client app. The client app should pass this URI to the remote desktop client app which will in turn call [GetForLaunchUri](xref:Windows.System.RemoteDesktop.Provider.RemoteDesktopConnectionRemoteInfo.GetForLaunchUri(Windows.Foundation.Uri) passing this launchUri as the parameter.

Remote desktop provider apps are launched by the OS through URI schemes with the following syntax.

`ms-remotedesktop:switch? remoteDesktopId={remote desktop Id}&correlationId={correlation Id}& supportBluetoothSettings=false`

Remote desktop client apps must subscribe to the `ms-remotedesktop` URI scheme to enable launching Cloud PCs using FastSwitch.

`ms-remotedesktop-launch:?supportBluetoothSettings ={true if local PC supports Bluetooth settings page} &correlationId={correlation Id}`

Remote desktop client apps must subscribe to the `ms-remotedesktop-launch` Uri scheme if they want to launch Cloud PCs using Boot to Cloud.
